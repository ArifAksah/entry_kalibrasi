# Fix Pagination Bug in Station Assignment

## Problem
The station assignment page was not displaying all available stations due to a pagination conflict:

1. **Server-side pagination**: The `useStations` hook was fetching stations with server-side pagination (default 10 items per page)
2. **Client-side pagination**: The `user-station-assignment.tsx` component was applying additional client-side pagination on the already paginated data
3. **Result**: Only the first 10 stations were available for assignment, making it impossible to assign stations from other pages

## Solution
Created a dedicated API endpoint `/api/stations/all` that returns all stations without pagination, specifically for assignment purposes.

### Changes Made:

1. **New API Endpoint**: `app/api/stations/all/route.ts`
   - Returns all stations without pagination
   - Ordered by name for better UX
   - Simple GET endpoint for fetching all stations

2. **Updated Component**: `app/ui/dashboard/user-station-assignment.tsx`
   - Removed dependency on `useStations` hook
   - Added local state management for stations
   - Added `fetchAllStations()` function that calls the new endpoint
   - Maintained client-side pagination for display purposes (10 stations per page)
   - All stations are now loaded and available for assignment

### Benefits:
- ✅ All stations are now available for assignment
- ✅ Client-side pagination still works for better UX (shows 10 stations per page)
- ✅ Search functionality works across all stations
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Better performance for assignment workflow

### Technical Details:
- The assignment page now loads all stations at once (typically not a large dataset)
- Client-side pagination is maintained for display purposes
- Search and filtering work on the complete dataset
- Station selection state is preserved across pagination

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to the station assignment page
2. Select a user
3. Verify that all stations are available for assignment (not just the first 10)
4. Test pagination - should show all stations across multiple pages
5. Test search functionality - should search across all stations
